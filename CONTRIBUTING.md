### üí° Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please:
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a detailed description of the proposed enhancement
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful

### üîß Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Commit with clear messages (`git commit -m 'Add support for XYZ laptop'`)
6. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Scripts**: Must pass shellcheck validation
- **Documentation**: Clear, concise, and properly formatted
- **Testing**: Confirm changes work on actual hardware when possible

### üìù Documentation

Documentation improvements are highly valued! This includes:

## Code Style Guidelines

### Bash Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Use meaningful variable names
DISPLAY_CONFIG="/home/user/.config/displays"

# Add error handling
set -euo pipefail

# Comment complex operations
# This configures the external monitor for 144Hz gaming
xrandr --output DP-1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 144

# Use functions for repeated code
check_nvidia_driver() {
    if ! command -v nvidia-smi &> /dev/null; then
        return 1
    fi
    return 0
}
```

### Markdown
- Use clear headings with proper hierarchy
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Add tables for structured data
- Use badges where appropriate
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 chars)

## Testing

Before submitting:
1. Test scripts on fresh Pop!_OS installation if possible
2. Verify all commands work as expected
3. Check for typos and formatting issues
4. Ensure documentation matches code behavior
